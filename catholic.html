            <div class="text">Media is known for exaggerating stories and misrepresenting the people they report on to create a more appealing article. Catholics are not exempt. So how does this affect them?
            <br><br>To find out we'll look at a specific example: the representation of the new Pope Leo and his election in the media.
            <h3>Context</h3>
            In June 2025, Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost was elected as Pope Leo XIV, becoming the first American Pope. This is a historic moment as the Pope has always traditionally been European.  The election brought attention to the rising influence of the United States in religion. 
            <br><br>
            Prevost held great importance for peace, missionary work, and social justice. He criticised the US government's immigration and refugee policies during Donald Trump’s presidency. This made him a voice for the marginalised, but he was controversial to conservatives and traditional Catholics. The media reflected these political tensions surrounding his election. Progressive media sources worry about America’s growing power, while conservative media sources were disappointed, thinking Pope Leo would continue Pope Francis’s progressive ideas rather than orthodox traditions. When Pope Leo gave his speech, he spoke in many languages but intentionally avoided speaking in English. This might be to avoid the people fearing American dominance in Catholicism. 
            <br><br>
            Pope Leo XIV’s election emphasises a shift in the Catholic Church, where global representation, leadership, and politics are greatly considered. This has triggered important discussions about the role of religion in politics, the American influence on faith, and the media’s influence on public reactions to religion. 
            <br><br>
            The election emphasises how religion, media, and politics interact, proving that a religious leader's background turns into political debates. Media outlets focused on national identity and politics, using the election to push their political views. Due to the media’s contrasting views, it proves that Catholic leadership can be framed or misrepresented not based on faith, but on the media’s political and cultural views. The coverage also portrays how political biases shape the public’s perspective of religious events, not treating the election as a unifying religious moment, but weaponising it to cause political division. 

            <br><br>Let's take a look at different outlets who reported on the election of the new Pope Leo - the ABC, the Conversation and the Guardian:<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class="text">Can you see the bias? It may look insignificant now, but as well see later, different portrayls in media can get harmful. If we compare the "What do they think of this?" section of each, we can see The Conversation emphasises the opposition of a U.S. Pope much more strongly than the other two, calling Leo's election "unexpected and significant"! The Guardian isn't free from this either; they may be more moderate, but they still call the election "stunning". The ABC mentions this taboo around a U.S pope, but it has the least bias in this case, making no comments on how this reflects on leo. These biases may show a fear of an American Pope, or a subtle dislike of the values of Pope Leo.<br><br>
            <h3>The effects of the bias</h3>
            The examples above were pretty moderate, so you might not see the point. But <em>everyone</em> has bias like this! Catholics are often represented as or assumed to be conservative. This is, of course, not always true! These little assumptions and judgments can build up to some pretty negative sentiments and stereotypes when they are widespread. The only way to avoid this is by acknowledging our biases, and this is all without considering the more extreme cases! It's not hard to find people online expressing hatred for catholics, and you don't have to look very far into history to find it.
            Catholics who don't fit in to these stereotypes, of course, may feel targeted for their beliefs as a result. Many liberal catholics may feel pressured or invalidated in their beliefs for not conforming to conservative stereotypes, feeling as though their beliefs do not align with their religion.
            More specifically, the way the articles above focus on the taboo around a U.S. pope may cause american catholics to feel alienated or excluded from their religion. The characterisation of Pope Leo in the media affects the public opinion of the pope, potentially causing conflict or unrest.
