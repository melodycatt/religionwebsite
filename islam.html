  <h2>Background & Perspective</h2>
  The perspective of this source is from Faize Patel and Rachel Levinson-Waldman. Both are legal scholars with backgrounds in civil liberties. They both lean progressive and Liberal on the political spectrum, often speaking about civil rights through pro-muslim perspectives.  
  <br><br>
  The publisher, ‘Brennan Center’, is known for its progressive liberal articles. They frequently challenge policies perceived as threatening democracy, civil rights, or minorities. Their research often supports reform-oriented, inclusive policies, especially around immigration, surveillance, and anti-discrimination.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Why does this article not speak for all Muslims?</h3>
  It is important to realise that this article speaks for many, but not all, Muslims. By generalising what Muslims believe into a political view, many perspectives from  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Overgeneralization of Muslim Views</h3>
  The article speaks on behalf of “Muslims” as a monolithic group, implying that all Muslims are in opposition to Trump’s policies and share the experiences of discrimination in the system. But Muslims are diverse in race, class, and politics. Some Muslims support Trump (~15% in 2016 and 2020), support stricter immigration and security laws, or disapprove of the victim mentality.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Critics of Islamist Extremism within the Muslim Community</h3>
  Many Muslims acknowledge that some people of their faith are violent extremists, and do not endorse destructive behaviour. They might disagree with how the article downplays the real risks of radicalisation or terrorism.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>How this article alienates and polarises people</h3>
  The Brennan Center’s report, “The Islamophobic Administration”, is a sharply critical analysis of the Trump administration’s treatment of Muslims in the U.S. While it is grounded in legal and civil rights arguments, its tone, framing, and generalisations can contribute to political polarisation and alienation in several ways:  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Buzzwords and Aggressive Tone</h3>
  The title, “The Islamophobic Administration,” frames the Trump Administration as intentionally anti-Islam, using buzzwords such as ‘Islamophobic’. They also equate policies with bigotry in “This administration has embedded bigotry at the highest levels of government”. This sets a strong oppositional stance against the right wing.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>One-Sided Framing</h3>
  The article characterises perspectives that contradict them as bigoted and Islamophobic. It fails to address the very legitimate concerns about national security, immigration policy goals, and counterterrorism. It also fails to address the perspective of Muslims who advocate for a cautious and moderate policy approach. This framing polarises debate by suggesting that any concern about Islamic extremism is Islamophobia, and oversimplifying everything into Islam vs evil government.  
  <br><br>

  <h2>Effects of Polarisation on Different Groups</h2>
  The article can have a polarising effect across political and religious groups, particularly in how it frames Muslims and those who support national security measures. While the article aims to highlight discrimination and defend civil liberties, its framing may unintentionally deepen political divides.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Muslims</h3>
  Many Muslims may feel that they must follow politics in accordance with how the media characterises them. Conservative-leaning Muslims feel shamed for agreeing with “anti-Islam” policies, while liberal leaning Muslims are radicalised to hate conservative beliefs.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Conservatives</h3>
  Many conservatives may feel targeted and falsely accused of being Islamophobic for simply supporting national security. This alienates them from centrist views, causing polarisation and leading to radicalisation.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Progressives</h3>
  Many progressives may be illusioned to believe that Muslims are victims who agree with progressive views. The article also polarises and radicalises them to hate conservative views and policies.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Neutral Parties</h3>
  Many neutral or moderate parties may feel pressured to choose a side by making them believe that any hesitation to condemn the policies is the same as compliance. This moral pressure discourages productive discussion and polarises people.  
  <br><br>

  <h2>Muslim Teaching</h2>

  <h3>Speaking Truthfully on Behalf of Islam</h3>
  “And do not say about what your tongues assert falsely, ‘This is lawful and this is unlawful,’ to fabricate lies against Allah.”  
  <br>
  (Qur’an 16:116)  
  <br><br>
  Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) is the tradition that only qualified scholars (ulama) may derive religious rulings after careful interpretation.  
  <br><br>
  The Qur’an disapproves of falsely speaking about God or their faith, especially for personal or political gain. This verse condemns speaking for Islam without proper knowledge or bending religious teachings to fit personal ideologies. This includes generalising the experiences of Muslims.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Remaining Open Minded and Unjudgmental</h3>
  “O you who have believed, avoid much assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it.”  
  <br>
  (Qur’an 49:12)  
  <br><br>
  Akhlaq (Islamic Ethics) and Ummah (Community Cohesion) are traditions that encourage harmony and unity in the Islamic community.  
  <br><br>
  Misrepresentation often arises from ignorance and misunderstandings. This verse emphasises how assumptions harm community cohesion. This applies to both media that misrepresents Muslims and divisions in the Muslim community, where people backbite each other based on politics.  
  <br><br>

  <h3>Encouraging Diversity in Opinion</h3>
  “Differences among my community are a mercy.” (Reported in al-Bayhaqi)  
  <br><br>
  Ijtihad (Scholarly Interpretation) is the tradition that supports conversation and scholarly debates.  
  <br><br>
  Islam acknowledges and celebrates the diversity of the people in their faith.  
  <br><br>
  Islam encourages respectful disagreements and shows that political differences in a society are not only natural but are a form of mercy. Therefore, the idea that all Muslims must vote or think a certain way contradicts their teachings.
